# BusPe
Submission for FTX Hackathon by Johny Samuael, Saket Kattuboina, Aditya Katti and Neil Bagewadi
## Secure Pay on the go

- Paying with cash to buy tickets on the bus is a hassle for most people these days.
- With the rise of UPI and other cashless modes of payment, our project focuses on a web app payment for buses with an app that can be used by the conductor to verify the authenticity

# Modules :

- ### Customer App (Webapp/android/IOS) [demo Video](https://www.loom.com/embed/c6537f0a7a5047f7a9f77e381f264676)
  - The user who rides the bus can select the route using our drop down menus.
  - The interface automatically calculates the price of the route
  - When user clicks on Pay, it opens up the RazorPay portal to make the payment
  - After the payment is done, A show ticket button shows up. When that is clicked a QR Code is generated
  - This QR Code contains the payment Id fetched from the checkout API used to maek payment with RazorPay
  - The QR Code can be scanned by the Conductor to see if the ticket is genuine by validating the time stamps and the [payment id]
- ### Conductor App (Webapp/android/IOS) :
   - The conductor can scan the code that the user shows
   - When scanned, the razorpay's payments API route is used to fetch the necessary information 
     to validate the ticket and the timestamps.

- ### API Bridges Hosted on our deta cloud :
   - The api bridge takes input of our values from the mobile app and used the API keys that we have hidden in the cloud, so no data leak happens.
   - This prevents from reverse engineering our app and getting the API details
   - We have used FASTApi to achieve the same
